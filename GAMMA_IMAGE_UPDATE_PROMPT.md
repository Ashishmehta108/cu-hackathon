1. **Remove any images of:**
   - Old people sitting or elderly figures
   - Traditional/aged settings or environments
   - Hand-drawn or sketchy illustrations
   - Vintage or historical-looking imagery

2. **Replace with modern visuals:**
   - Contemporary people (any age) using technology (smartphone, microphone, tablet)
   - Modern, clean icons representing knowledge (document icons, database icons, cloud storage)
   - Abstract geometric shapes representing data/knowledge flow
   - Tech-forward illustrations (line art style, minimal, geometric)
   - Modern recording scenarios (person with microphone, voice recording interface)
   - Contemporary community members (diverse, modern clothing, using devices)

3. **Visual style for knowledge/wiki slides:**
   - Show knowledge as digital data flowing into a database
   - Use modern icons: microphone → transcription → translation → database
   - Abstract representations: flowing lines, connected nodes, digital archive
   - Contemporary UI elements: modern app interfaces, clean dashboards
   - People recording knowledge using smartphones or modern devices (not sitting traditionally)

4. **Color scheme:**
   - Deep slate/dark blue-gray (#1a1f2e)
   - Clean white backgrounds
   - Subtle light grays for accents
   - Modern, professional aesthetic

5. **Overall feel:**
   - Tech startup / modern SaaS product
   - Contemporary civic tech platform
   - Professional, polished, forward-thinking
   - Knowledge shown as recent and current (can be from 2-3 months ago), not ancient

**Remember:** Traditional knowledge doesn't mean old-looking visuals. Show it as modern, digital, and contemporary - like a current tech solution being documented and preserved.
