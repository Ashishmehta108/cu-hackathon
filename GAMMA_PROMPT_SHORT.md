# Awaaz - Short Gamma Prompt (Copy & Paste This)

Create a **modern, professional presentation** about **Awaaz** - a hyperlocal community intelligence platform for Indian rural communities.

**Target Audience:** Social impact investors, NGO program leads, and government/municipal stakeholders in India

**Tone:** Warm, clear, community-focused, and confidently modern (American English)

**Output Language:** American English

**Amount of Text:** Minimal and impactful. Maximum 5-7 bullet points per slide, concise headlines under 10 words.

**Visual Style:** 
- **Modern, clean, professional** - Contemporary tech startup aesthetic (think Stripe, Linear, modern civic tech)
- **Color Palette:** Deep slate/dark blue-gray primary (#1a1f2e), clean white backgrounds, subtle light grays for accents, muted blues/teals for data
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif (Lato/Inter style), clean and legible
- **Design:** Minimal geometric shapes, clean icons (line art style), generous white space, subtle shadows, rounded corners (0.5rem), card-based layouts
- **Avoid:** Traditional/old-fashioned visuals, images of old people sitting or aged imagery, bright saturated colors, cluttered layouts, hand-drawn illustrations. Traditional knowledge should be shown as modern and recent (can be from 2-3 months ago), not ancient or elderly-focused.

**Title:** Awaaz: Voice of the Community - Bridging Civic Complaints with Traditional Wisdom Through AI

**Problem:** Two crises: (1) Citizens can't voice complaints in regional languages, (2) Community knowledge and local solutions are disappearing (even recent ones from 2-3 months ago).

**Solution:** Awaaz has two core features: (1) Voice Complaint Engine - citizens record complaints in any Indian language, AI transcribes, categorizes, clusters similar complaints, and drafts formal petitions to government. (2) Community Wiki - community members record knowledge (farming, water management, remedies - can be recent, from 2-3 months back), AI preserves and translates to English/Hindi, makes it searchable.

**Magic Link Feature:** When a complaint is filed, AI automatically searches the wiki for relevant community knowledge that could solve the problem. Example: "No water for 3 months" complaint → finds community's entry on rainwater harvesting technique (from recent months) → community can self-solve before petition reaches government.

**Visual Note:** Show traditional knowledge as modern and contemporary - avoid images of old people sitting or aged/traditional imagery. Knowledge can be recent (2-3 months old) and should be presented in a modern, tech-forward way.

**Tech Stack:** React + TypeScript (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), Firebase Firestore (database), Sarvam AI (STT, TTS, LLM, Translation in 22 Indian languages), Pinecone (vector search for Magic Link).

**Key Features:** Voice recording in any Indian language, real-time AI transcription, automatic categorization, complaint clustering, auto-generated petitions, multilingual wiki search, Magic Link connections, community upvoting.

**Impact:** Enables citizens to voice concerns in native language, provides government with structured complaints, preserves cultural heritage, creates data-driven governance model for rural India.

**Overall Feel:** Modern SaaS product, contemporary civic tech platform, professional startup pitch deck - polished, trustworthy, and forward-thinking. Use visual-first approach with minimal text, modern iconography, and clean layouts.
