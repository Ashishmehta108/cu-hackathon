## Prompt for Gamma:

**Update Slide 5: "Preserving Community Knowledge" / "How It Works - Community Wiki"**

**Remove:**
- Any images of old people sitting
- Traditional/aged settings or environments
- Elderly figures in traditional poses
- Vintage or historical-looking imagery
- Hand-drawn or sketchy illustrations

**Replace with:**
- Contemporary person (any age) using a smartphone or modern device to record knowledge
- Modern voice recording interface or microphone setup
- Clean, geometric icons showing: microphone → transcription → translation → database
- Abstract knowledge flow diagram (digital data flowing into archive)
- Modern app interface showing knowledge being recorded
- Contemporary community member using technology (tablet, phone, microphone)
- Tech-forward illustrations (minimal line art, geometric shapes)

**Visual Style:**
- Modern, clean, professional
- Deep slate/dark blue-gray color scheme (#1a1f2e)
- Contemporary tech aesthetic
- Show knowledge as digital and current (can be from 2-3 months ago)
- Professional SaaS/product design feel

**Remember:** Traditional knowledge doesn't mean old-looking. Show it as modern, digital, and contemporary - like someone documenting a recent solution using current technology.

## Quick Copy-Paste Version:

On **Slide 5** ("Preserving Community Knowledge" / "How It Works - Community Wiki"), replace any images of old people sitting or traditional/aged imagery with modern visuals: contemporary person using smartphone/microphone to record, modern voice recording interface, clean geometric icons showing knowledge flow (microphone → transcription → translation → database), or abstract digital data visualization. Show knowledge as modern and digital, not ancient. Use contemporary tech aesthetic - deep slate colors (#1a1f2e), clean design, professional SaaS feel. Knowledge can be recent (2-3 months old) and should look like a current tech solution being documented.
