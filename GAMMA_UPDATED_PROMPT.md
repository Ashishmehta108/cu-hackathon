### 3. Slide-by-Slide Guidance

#### Slide 1 – Welcome / Title

- **Title:** Awaaz  
- **Subtitle:** Voice of the Community  
- **Tagline:** Bridging Civic Complaints with Community Knowledge Through AI  
- **Visual:** Abstract, modern connection graphic (nodes/lines, sound waves, or data flow), not literal people photos. Layout should feel like a clean product landing page.

#### Slide 2 – Agenda

- 4–5 bullets: Problem, Solution, How It Works, Impact, Next Steps.  
- Keep very minimal; this is just a roadmap.

#### Slide 3 – The Problem (Two Crises)

- Highlight:  
  - Unheard civic complaints (language + access barriers, unstructured data)  
  - Disappearing community knowledge (local solutions, including recent ones from the last 2–3 months)  
- **Visual:**  
  - Modern icons and abstract “information loss” imagery  
  - No “old person sitting” visuals, no nostalgic or sepia styling.

#### Slide 4 – Solution Overview

- Show the **two superpowers + Magic Link**:  
  - Voice Complaint Engine  
  - Community Knowledge Wiki (recent + traditional)  
  - Magic Link connecting the two  
- **Visual:** Central platform with two streams (Complaints + Knowledge) joined via a highlighted “Magic Link” band.

#### Slide 5 – Community Knowledge / Wiki (Key modernization)

- Content: community members (any age) record knowledge (farming, water, remedies, etc.), AI transcribes, translates, tags, and stores it in a searchable wiki. Knowledge can be **recent (2–3 months ago)** as well as long-standing practices.
- **Replace any existing traditional / old visuals with:**  
  - Contemporary person (any age) using a smartphone, tablet, or microphone to record  
  - A modern voice-recording UI (waveform, mic icon, progress)  
  - A digital flow: **microphone → transcription → translation → tags → searchable database**  
  - Abstract digital data flowing into a database or cloud  
- **Strictly avoid on this slide:**  
  - Images of old people sitting, or stereotypical “village elder” imagery  
  - Vintage, sepia, or nostalgic aesthetics  
- Overall feel: **current, digital, tech-forward** – like a modern knowledge tool, not an old archive.

#### Slide 6 – Complaint Engine (How It Works)

- Show a clean 5–7 step flow:  
  1. Record complaint (any Indian language)  
  2. AI transcribes to text  
  3. AI categorizes and extracts keywords  
  4. System clusters similar complaints  
  5. AI drafts a formal petition  
  6. Magic Link checks knowledge wiki  
  7. Dashboard displays results  
- **Visual:** modern horizontal or vertical flow with icons, thin connectors, and lots of white space.

#### Slide 7 – Magic Link Example

- Example:  
  - Complaint: “No water for 3 months”  
  - Keywords: water, shortage, village  
  - Wiki match: community’s rainwater harvesting technique (from recent months)  
  - Outcome: community self-solves before escalation  
- **Visual:** clean card-based layout linking a “Complaint” card to a “Knowledge” card. No traditional imagery, just modern UI-style components.

#### Slide 8 – Technology Stack

- Show React + TypeScript, Node.js + Express, Firebase Firestore, Sarvam AI, Pinecone, Vercel.  
- **Visual:** neat row or grid of logos with subtle dividers, consistent sizing, and labels. Minimal background.

#### Slide 9 – Key Features

- Grid of feature cards (icons + 1 line):  
  - Voice recording (22+ Indian languages)  
  - AI transcription & categorization  
  - Complaint clustering  
  - Auto-generated petitions  
  - Multilingual knowledge search  
  - Magic Link connections  
  - Community upvoting and stats  
- **Visual:** 2×4 or 3×3 card grid, modern icons, minimal labels.

#### Slide 10 – Impact & Vision

- **Immediate impact:**  
  - Citizens can speak in their native language  
  - Government receives structured, actionable data  
  - Communities surface existing solutions quickly  
- **Long-term vision:**  
  - Largest hyperlocal knowledge graph  
  - Data-driven rural governance  
  - Preserving culture while solving real problems  
- **Visual:** modern, simple charts or metric blocks; no 3D or flashy graphs.

#### Slide 11 – Demo / Experience

- Show the core flow through app-like screens:  
  - Record complaint → AI processing → dashboard → Magic Link → wiki.  
- **Visual:** stylized screen mockups inside simple device frames; same color palette and UI tone as the rest of the deck.

#### Slide 12 – Next Steps / Call to Action

- Short bullets: pilots, partnerships (NGOs, government), data and deployment plans.  
- Simple, focused layout.

#### Slide 13 – Thank You

- Large “Thank you” text plus contact details (email/website/QR if needed).  
- Very minimal, calm layout with a subtle abstract background or single modern icon.  
- Tone: **warm, confident, welcoming** – like a startup pitch closing slide.

### 4. Global DO / DON’T

- **DO:**  
  - Modern SaaS / civic-tech look  
  - Subtle colors, clean icons, card layouts, white space  
  - Consistent spacing and alignment across all slides  
- **DON’T:**  
  - Old/nostalgic or stereotypical rural imagery  
  - Images centered on “old people sitting” for knowledge  
  - Bright saturated oranges/greens, heavy gradients, or textured backgrounds  
  - Cluttered slides or walls of text  

Apply this updated style and content guidance consistently across the entire deck, with extra attention to the **Community Knowledge (Slide 5)**, **Welcome**, and **Thank You** slides so they feel cohesive, subtle, and premium.
